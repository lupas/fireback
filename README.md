> Firebase Backup CLI that makes backing up and restoring Firebase services a breeze.

This Node.js modules helps you backing up and restoring your Firebase services such as Firebase Firestore or Authentication in a breeze.

Give it a go and feel free to add additional helper functions to the repository!

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è IMPORTANT - DISCLAIMER ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è

PLEASE make sure to _understand what this tool does_. We do not recommend you using this tool without learning what it might do with your data.

If you do not, you might end up with **high Firebase bills**, **data loss** or other painful experiences.

Please **DO NOT use this applciation if you are not aware what effects backups and restores to your Firebase data might have**.

We do not take any responsibility for any damage the use of this module might do to your data or your billing records.

That being said, the application is meant to simplify the process of backing up and restoring Firebase data and if used wisely, should not pose any risk to your Firebase projects. Just be careful :)

## Requirements

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system (the newer, the better).

## Setup

1. Install fireback in the folder where your firebase.json is located:

```bash
npm i fireback
// or
yarn add fireback
```

2. Create a file called `fireback.config.mjs`

3. Configure `fireback.config.mjs`:

```js
export default {
  //
  projects: ["test1-project", "test2-project", "test3-project"]
};
```

## Run

To run the CLI tool, simply enter `fireback` in your CLI.

```bash
fireback
```

## More

This tool was quickly built for myself and is not yet a sophisticated solution at all.

If you like it, please feel free to contribute by improving its messy code or adding further functionality.

I am planning to automating backups for other Firebase services and simplifying the processes even more in the future. Until then I hope it's already useful :)
